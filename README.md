# nix-nar-kaitai-spec

[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

Kaitai Struct specification for the Nix Archive (.nar) format.

## Why
Having a declarative Kaitai spec makes inspection, tooling, and integration easier across languages. It's a great way to validate our own [Nix spec](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/protocols/nix-archive).

If you would like to see the spec, please see the [NAR.ksy](./NAR.ksy) file.
